It has been found that the best way to learn how to make a secure system is to know how to break it. In security, the proof of the pudding quite literally lies in the eating, and therefore any system is only as secure as easy it is to break it.

This course aims to do just this. You can get an idea of what we hope to cover in the [curriculum](/InfoSec-2026/curriculum) page. A thorough knowledge to C programming is required. Additionally, it would do you good to have a knack for solving problems, because we would be solving a lot of them. Other details regarding the course are given in the course details [page](/InfoSec-2026/about).
