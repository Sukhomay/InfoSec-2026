# Do you think like Mr Robot?
We have seen in [Season 3, Episode 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eps3.0_power-saver-mode.h) of [Mr Robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot) that he likes to solve problems and is, in fact, very good at it. If you believe that you can think like him, then the following problems should be fun for you.

Each problem has a **hidden flag** somewhere. A flag is a piece of text. Find the flags and submit them in the Google form link below. Have fun and good luck!

**Google Form** (can only be submitted once): [Form Link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfn7bid87YmAIuInAtN7cFWr6Q1rIRcrEUROXbiIZn3zZR1lQ/viewform)

## 2. Beep. Boop. Binary.
Mr Robot finally got a [binary file](/static_files/puzzle_files/hackme). Help him find the flag.


## 3. One Image. One Chance.
A compromised system.
A locked terminal. 
One [image](/static_files/puzzle_files/p3.png) is what left.

In a move straight out of Mr. Robot, Elliot left behind a single distorted image after taking down the system. No text. No logs. No explanation. The engineers believe the passcode isn’t encrypted—
it’s hidden.

Embedded in the image. In plain sight. Waiting for someone who knows how to look.
No brute force.
No second chances.

Find the passcode.
